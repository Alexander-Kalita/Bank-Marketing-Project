    "The first part of the Portuguese bank deposit project primarily focused on Machine Learning (ML) model development [1]. This phase encompasses essential steps such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the true value of the ML model lies in its practical implementation, which necessitates the adoption of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) principles. This critical component covers tasks such as model development, deployment and management in diverse environment settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the project offers an end-to-end solution for predicting future bank deposit subscriptions resulting from a marketing campaign conducted by the Portuguese bank. The ML model is presented as a simple and interactive application named Depositer, accessible through an online web domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Depositer application addresses a common challenge encountered by deposit marketers: inefficient allocation of marketing budgets towards targeting customers who are unlikely to subscribe to term deposits. It accurately identifies the desired customer group and optimizes telemarketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study concludes by highlighting the challenges associated with Data, ML algorithms and modern MLOps practices in achieving tangible business outcomes."

    "In this section, the design considerations of the ML Depositer application were explored, utilizing the ML canvas framework to systematically address key aspects [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the following facets of product design that were taken into account:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**. The Depositer application is designed to assist marketers in targeting potential subscribers during deposit marketing campaigns. By doing so, it helps to minimize the inefficiencies associated with identifying the desired customer group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Value proposition**. Depositer utilizes various customer features such as age, occupation, and call duration to differentiate potential bank deposit subscribers from non-subscribers. By leveraging this predictive capability, users can optimize their marketing efforts by targeting individuals more likely to subscribe, thereby saving time and marketing resources that would otherwise be spent on individually contacting every customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives**. The key objective of Depositer is to identify potential subscribers for a bank deposit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**. The Depositer application fulfills its primary objective by providing fast predictions with low latency (<100ms). Additionally, it offers a user-friendly minimalistic UI interface for ease of use, and ensures the security of the website with HTTPS encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feasibility**. Depositer is designed as a prototype with all the necessary resources readily available for its development.\n",
    "\n",
    "When discussing the system design, it is crucial to cover the following aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**. The Depositer ML model utilizes a dataset of 45,211 instances, encompassing socio-demographic characteristics, financial backgrounds, and telemarketing campaign interactions. This dataset was sourced from a Portuguese retail bank between May 2008 and November 2010 and is publicly available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics**. Focusing on the balance of metrics was key, resulting in notable achievements such as an 88.4% accuracy rate and an 85% Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), effectively distinguising potential subscribers from non-subscribers. Additionally, the model successfully identified 80% of potential subscribers while minimizing false positives to just 10%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation**. Offline evaluation involved splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets using a 70%/30% ratio. During model training, 5-fold cross-validation was conducted, dividing the data into 5 samples. Each sample demonstrated a cross-validation accuracy of around 91% (with a margin of ±1%). For online evaluation, the model's performance is continuously assessed in real-world settings by making predictions using various features outlined in the Depositer application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modeling**. The approach to modeling Depositer involved initial manual testing of core model aspects in a local environment, followed by execution in the production environment with 1-2 user tests. Once functionality was confirmed, focus shifted to automation and increased user testing in the production cloud. Continuous feedback and prompt error resolution were prioritized throughout the iterative process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inference**. Depositer operates by processing batch predictions, where multiple input data points are sent to the Flask server at once, and predictions for all these data points are calculated simultaneously. Users initiate requests via the UI interface and promptly receive prediction values in response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback**.  A robust system has been implemented to automatically gather feedback across various aspects of the Depositer application. \n",
    "This system is designed for quick problem-solving during production.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project**. Depositer was developed entirely by a single developer, covering all aspects from inception to management."

    "The MLOps architecture of the Depositer application consists of two main parts. The first part covers solely on data exploration and analysis, detailed in a separate file [1]. The second part, which is the focus of this project, encompasses all other components of the pipeline. Each aspect of the Depositer MLOps pipeline will be discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project pipeline begins with the upload of the dataset and exploratory data analysis conducted in JupyterLab, where the XGBoost model emerged as the best trained model. This initial phase constitutes the first part of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, the trained XGBoost model underwent version control using Git, and various experiments were conducted with MLflow in a pipenv virtual environment. The model was locally tested using a Flask server in the local environment, and important feature reliability tests, such as explanations with SHAP values and bias feature assessment, were carried out. Additionally, the model was then tested in a local environment using a Streamlit UI to showcase the Depositer application online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving to the pre-production stage, the focus was on deploying the model in a production-ready environment. This involved deploying the model on Gunicorn and Streamlit servers, which were thoroughly tested. The servers were containerized using Docker, connected with Docker Compose, and pushed to an online container repository on Docker Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Terraform was employed to automate the setup of the AWS cloud environment and prepare various AWS services for the production deployment of Depositer. These AWS services complemented the core project components deployed on the AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EKS cluster was hosted on virtual AWS servers (Elastic Cloud Compute - EC2), where Gunicorn and Streamlit servers were deployed. Traefik reverse proxy was installed using Helm, along with the Traefik dashboard and ExternalDNS, facilitating the management of Depositer application predictions online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the management component of the project encompasses all other project parts, maintaining version control with Git, pushing the project to an online repository on GitHub, and automating Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions, thereby establishing a comprehensive MLOps pipeline."

    "The project concludes with the following issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**. The current project utilizes an open-source dataset from a Portuguese bank, specifically designed for predicting customer deposit subscriptions. While this dataset serves as a valuable resource, it has limitations in terms of size and collection period. Finding similar datasets suitable for ML projects can be challenging. To address this issue, there is an intriguing solution involving synthetic data generation. By generating synthetic data that mirrors the properties of the real dataset, it can expand the dataset size and potentially enhance prediction accuracy. This approach offers a promising avenue for experimentation in future iterations of the project [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm**. While the XGBoost model served as a state-of-the-art decision tree ensemble algorithm for handling tabular data in the project, its performance falls short compared to deep learning models with supervised self-learning capabilities, particularly when applied to audio, video, and text data. The urgent demand for a deep learning algorithm tailored to the specific heterogeneity of tabular data remains unmet. Unfortunately, research efforts aimed at combining the strengths of deep learning models with decision tree ensembles have stagnated [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture**. The MLOps architecture aims to balance between simplicity and comprehensiveness by encompassing diverse technical components outlined in the ongoing research [7]. It adopts modern microservice infrastructure principles for efficient and effective management of ML workflows such as simplicity, speed, reliability, versioning, security, scalability, reproducibility, automation, and ethics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business outcome**. Deposit marketers have traditionally struggled with navigating extensive customer lists, often resulting in inefficient allocation of marketing budgets to reach the desired target customer group. The ML model integrated into the Depositer application addresses this critical challenge in deposit marketing by accurately identifying the target audience of potential deposit subscribers for telemarketing campaigns. By directing marketing resources towards customers with a higher likelihood of conversion, it significantly enhances efficiency and boosts return on investment (ROI) for telemarketing campaigns."
