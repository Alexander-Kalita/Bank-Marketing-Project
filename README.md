# Predicting telemarketing success in the banking sector: the case of Portuguese bank

## Summary
The current project focuses on the prediction of bank deposit subscriptions based on the marketing campaign data conduced by a Portuguese bank. For now, it is completed in two parts:
The first part of the project in ![Kalita-A-Bank-marketing-ML](https://github.com/Alexander-Kalita/Bank-Marketing-Project/blob/main/Kalita-A-Bank-marketing-ML.ipynb) focuses solely on the Machine Learning (ML) model preparation such aspects as dataset description, data exploration, data cleaning and preliminary data analysis. It proceeds with training and evaluating several classification ML models with picking the best model XGBoost with solid and balanced results like 88,4% accuracy, 85% ROC AUC and 80% TRP at 10% FPR.

The second part of the project in ![Kalita-A-Bank-marketing-ML](https://github.com/Alexander-Kalita/Bank-Marketing-Project/blob/main/Kalita-A-Bank-marketing-MLOps.ipynb) proceeds on to make an ML application named Depositer based on the best trained XGBoost model from the first part of the project. It dwells on such aspects of development environment as versioning and experimenting of the model as well as through local testing. Then, the model passes to the staging environment where it is prepared and containerized for production. Depositer works as expected in both development and staging environments.
